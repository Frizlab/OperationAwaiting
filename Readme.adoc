(A)waiting support for a Foundation’s `Operation`.

== Example of Use

[source,swift]
----
struct OperationNotStarted : Error {}

final class MyOperation : Operation, HasResult {
   
   var result: Result<Int, Error> = .failure(OperationNotStarted())
   
   override func main() {
      result = .success(42)
   }
   
}

let q = OperationQueue()
let op = MyOperation()
/* op.result is a failure, set to OperationNotStarted() */
let r = try await q.addOperationAndGetResult(op)
/* op.result is now a success, equal to r (equal to 42) */

== About the Naming of the Functions

All functions have a short name (which might be ambiguous) and a longer non-ambiguous name.

_Example_: The `start` and `startAndGetResult` methods.
When the context is clear, Swift can guess the `start` method you want to call is the one on an `Operation` which conforms to `HasResult` and you want to fetch the result of the operation when it’s done.
However it does not always work.
In particular, this code would set the variable to `()` even if `op` conforms to `HasResult`:
[source,swift]
----
let r = try await op.start()
